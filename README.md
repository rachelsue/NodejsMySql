This project is a mock amazon database that allows a user to select a product for purchase, adjust the quantity and get the total. The database updates the stock to keep track of avaiable quantities.

In the future I would like to add a manager view, where products and stock levels can be adjusted as well as keeping track of low inventory. I would also like to add a supervisor view that tracks products by department and keeps a record of overhead costs.

This project is solely maintained by rachelsue
